# People-Counter
ENGR114 Final Project: People Counter
It can be useful to know how many people are in a room when one cannot watch a door constantly. For example, in a daycare, a teacher MUST know how many people are in a room but obviously has a lot to pay attention to. Perhaps one must know how many people remain in an area, so they may ensure there is no one left in that room: For example, how many are left in an office at the end of the day? We will record and display a count of the people in a room at any given time by adding and subtracting as people enter and leave a room.
